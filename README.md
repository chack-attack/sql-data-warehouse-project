1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source system. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


📖 **Project Overview**
This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting:** Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

🚀 **Project Requirements**

  **Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**
  
**Objective**
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
**Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
**Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
**Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
**Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
**Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

**BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)**

**Objective**
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance
- Sales Trends
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
